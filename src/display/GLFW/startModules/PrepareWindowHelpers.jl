showing how openGL should read data from buffer in GPU
in case of code like below it would mean:

first parameter specifies which vertex attribute we want to configure Remember that we specified the location of the position vertex attribute in the vertex shader
next argument specifies the size of the vertex attribute. The vertex attribute is a vec2 so it is composed of 2 values. 
The third argument specifies the type of the data which is GL_FLOAT
next argument specifies if we want the data to be normalized. If we’re inputting integer data types like int, byte and we’ve set this to GL_TRUE
    The fifth argument is known as the stride and tells us the space between consecutive vertex attributes. Since the next set of position data is
     located exactly 2 times the size of a float we could’ve also specified the stride as 0 to let OpenGL determine the stride 
    he last parameter is of type void* and thus requires that weird cast. This is the offset of where the position data begins in the buffer.

glVertexAttribPointer positionAttribute, 2, GL_FLOAT, false, 0, C_NULL

    The position data is stored as 32-bit  so 4 byte floating point values. 
    Each position is composed of 2 of those values.
