Basically this function is defined for adding files written in this project
given path to the julia file and worker number this function will include the file under this path
to the given worker we need also to supply the name of the module that is in the included file in order to make it usable ..
```
function include_remote(path::String,  moduleName::String,workerNumbId::Int; mod=Main)
    open(path) do f
    text, s = read(f, String), 1
    while s <= length(text)
    ex, s = Meta.parse(text, s) # Parse text starting at pos s, return new s
    @spawnat workerNumbId Core.eval(mod, ex) # Evaluate the expression on workers
    @spawnat workerNumbId Main.eval(Meta.parse("using Main.$moduleName"))
    end
