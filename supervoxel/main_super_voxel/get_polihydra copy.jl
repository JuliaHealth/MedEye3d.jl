TODO basically we need to additionaly save the index of triangle and location basically in original tetr dat 
on this we can get idea what is connected and what not as the intersection of a plane with sv may lead to creation of 
non connected polygons - for those connected we can define triangluation by just geting a center - barycenter and then connnect it to any 2 neigbouring points 
1) we need to prepare earlier dict on the basis of pure int basic tetrdat of the neighbouring indicies within supervoxel 
2) in case of each intersection point we need to preserve information about original indexes of both points 
3) then in a loop we are 
    a)looking on the basis of prepared earlier dict to the first point associated with a supervoxel - we mutate the points la last entry (we need to add space for it) 
    with the integer of a current group so the points will be all 0 at the begining then we select one point and set it to one - on the bases of dict from 1 
    we look for neighbours of each end of the segment that given us this intersection point and we set the integer of the group to the last entry of the point/points that is neigbour - then we are checking those newly found 
    neigbours and repeat process; during the process we are additionally reordering the points in a group so points connected should be next to each other 
    also first and last point in a list has to be connected to each other
    b)if we do not find any neigbours for a given point (we know it on the basis of the fact that last entrt remain 0) we set it to the next integer in last position of the point and
    we are checking weather any of the remaning 0's points are connected to it if they are we are setting them to the same integer etc 
    c) we are repeating the process until there are no more 0's in the last entry of the points
    d) we filter out all of the groups that has less then 3 points 
    e) we add barycenter to the group 
    f) as we know that points next to each other are neighbours we can just connect them to the barycenter and we have a triangulation what will be usefull later
